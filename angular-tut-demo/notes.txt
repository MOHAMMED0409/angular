1. Binding Syntax
    a. Interpolation
        eg: In ts file
            hotelName = 'Hilton';
            In html file
            <h1>Welcome to {{hotelName}}</h1>
    b. Property Binding
        eg: In ts file
            numberOfRooms = 10;
            In html file
            <div [innerText]="numberOfRooms"></div>
            we use a property in html to bind the data from the ts file.
    c. Event Binding
        eg: In ts file
            hiddenroom = false;
            toggle(){
                this.hiddenroom = !this.hiddenroom;
            }
            In html file
            <div [hidden]="hiddenroom">
            Number of Rooms:
            <div [innerText]="numberOfRooms"></div>
            </div>
            <button (click)="toggle()">toggle</button>
    
2. Directives
    a. Introduction
        It is used to change the behavior and appearance of DOM elements.
        It can implement all lifecycle hooks.
        It can not have templates.
    b. Types of Directives
        i. Structural Directives
            *ngIf
            *ngFor
            *ngSwitch
            note: Optional Chaining and null collision
        ii. Attribute Directives
            ngClass
            ngStyle
    c. Build-in Directives

3. Pipes
    The pipes are used for data Transformation.
    Pipes doesn't change actual object.
    Build-in Pipes:
        1. DataPipe
        2. UppercasePipe
        3. LowercasePipe
        4. CurrencyPipe
        5. DecimalPipe
        6. PercentPipe
        7. JsonPipe
        8. SlicePipe
        9. AsyncPipe

4. Lifecycle hooks
    Change detection triggers these methods.
    They execute depending on the conditions of the current cycle.
    Types:
        ngOnChanges
        ngOnInit
        ngDoCheck
        ngAfterContentInit
        ngAfterContentChecked
        ngAfterViewedInit
        ngAfterViewedChecked
        ngOnDestory

5. Component Interaction
    1. @Input and @Output
    2. @ViewChild and @ContentChild
    3. Using Services

6. Dependency Injection
    It is services or objects needed by classes to perform some action.
    It is a design pattern.
    Angular has a build-in dependency injection support.
        DI providers:
            1. Class based providers.
            2. Value providers.
            3. Factory providers.
    Creating services
        ng g s <service-name>

7. Resolution Modifiers
    Self
    SkipSelf
    Optional
    Host
